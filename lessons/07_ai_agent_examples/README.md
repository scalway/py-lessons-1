# Lesson 7: AI Agent Examples

## Learning Objectives

- Understand basic AI agent concepts
- Learn about agent decision-making
- Explore simple agent architectures
- Understand state management
- Learn about agent behavior patterns

## Topics Covered

### 1. Simple Reflex Agents
- Condition-action rules
- Direct stimulus-response
- Rule-based systems

### 2. Model-Based Agents
- Internal state representation
- Environment modeling
- State tracking

### 3. Goal-Based Agents
- Goal representation
- Planning and search
- Path finding

### 4. Utility-Based Agents
- Utility functions
- Decision making
- Trade-off evaluation

## Examples

Run the examples to see different agent types in action:

```bash
python examples.py
```

## Key Concepts

- Agents perceive their environment through sensors
- Agents act on their environment through actuators
- Different agent types suit different problems
- State management is crucial for complex agents
- Simple agents can solve complex problems

## Note

These are conceptual examples demonstrating basic AI agent principles. For production AI/ML applications, consider using frameworks like:
- LangChain for LLM-based agents
- OpenAI API for GPT-based agents
- Hugging Face Transformers for model-based agents
